Title: Model Checking for High Dimensional Generalized Linear Models Based on Random Projections
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Wen Chen <tlqdcw@gmail.com>
Description: Description: This package provides methods for testing the goodness-of-fit 
    of generalized linear models using random projections. It is specifically 
    designed for high-dimensional scenarios where the number of predictor 
    substantially exceeds the sample size. The statistical methodologies 
    implemented in this package are described in recent research.
